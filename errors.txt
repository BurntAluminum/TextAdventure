Congratulations, you picked an invalid answer and won an error message.
Of all the invalid numbers you just had to pick that one.
Well that did nothing.
I don't believe that was an option.
Did you think that was a choice? It's not.
WOW!! Spectacular answer, too bad it isn't valid!
Don't be stupid, I don't like stupid.
You're stuck in the middle of nowhere, and you want to do THAT?
